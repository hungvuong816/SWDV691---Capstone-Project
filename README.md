# SWDV691---Capstone-Project

My project will be building an online API web application called Dating App. This web application is
designed to help people with different ages ranges, coming from various countries, races to connect
through internet web platform and make friends, connections, exchange messages, and find their
appropriate partners.
With this fast-moving world, everyone is very busy with work and schools, this application is designed to
give people with limited time to talk and exchange message. All they need is a smart devices and
internet connections through web browser.
My target users are young users who are spending lots of times using internet and social media, users
who are always busy with work that do not have time to hang out with friends, and widows/divorces an
opportunity to find their loves one more time.
This application has no cost to end users. By building up the number of users would get the application
more popular, and it will able to provide the builder/developer profits in term of marketing services and
commercial ads.
Users who are busy and have limited time can benefit from using the apps to add friends and talk before
getting into a real dating. Users just need to access through a device browser, sign up for an account
with their personal information, filter searches based on common filter types. The application will help
to suggest their matches, or they can search and look for appropriate one on their ends.
